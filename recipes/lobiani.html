    <h1>Lobiani Recipe</h1>
    <img src="/images/lobiani.jpg" alt="lobiani">
    <p>Basically, lobiani consists of just two things — a mashed red bean mixture stuffed inside a pastry.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>75ml (1/3 cup) warm milk (about 40°C or 102°F)</li>
        <li>4  grams (1 teaspoon) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 grams (1 teaspoon) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>200 grams (1 2/3 cups) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>8 grams (1 teaspoon) salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>15ml (1 tablespoon) sunflower oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>200 grams (1 cup) dried red or pinto beans, soaked overnight and cooked until tender OR 1 400 gram can red beans</li>
        <li>50 grams (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried savory or thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon blue fenugreek</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Dough</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve sugar in milk and stir in yeast until combined, set aside until foamy, about 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour and salt together in a large bowl, make a well in the centre and add egg, milk and yeast mixture and oil. Stir until combined and a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead dough until smooth and slightly tacky, about five minutes, kneading in more flour if the dough is too sticky.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough into a large, clean, oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and set aside at room temperature until nearly doubled in size, about 1-2 hours depending on how warm the room is.</li>

    </ol>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain beans and transfer to a large bowl. With a potato masher, mash beans until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add butter, savory, blue fenugreek, cayenne pepper and salt and pepper to taste. Stir until well combined. Set aside.
        </li>

    </ol>

    <h4>Assembly</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and position a rack in centre of oven.</li>
        <li>Lightly deflate dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough in a circle until about 4-5 (1/4 inch) millimetres thick.</li>
        <li>Place bean filling in the centre of the dough circle, leaving about 8 centimetres (3 inches) in diameter on all sides. Fold remaining dough over beans until the filling is completely covered by dough.</li>
        <li>Roll your rolling pin the dough over the beans, sealing it in and ensuring an even thickness of the crust. Roll out your lobiani until it reaches about 25 centimetres in diameter. Cut four 2.5 centimetre-long (1 inch) slits in the centre of the dough, for steam release.</li>
        <li>Transfer to oven for 10-15 minutes, or until lightly browned, crisp, and cooked through. Cut into wedges (like a pizza) and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
