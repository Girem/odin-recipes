    <p>This peanut butter recipe calls for just 1 or 2 ingredients,
         and it comes together in under 10 minutes. </p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dry roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons honey or sugar</li>
        <li>additional salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place peanuts in a food processor. Turn the food processor on and let it run for 4-5 minutes. During this time, you’ll see the peanuts go in stages from crumbs to a dry ball to a smooth and creamy “liquid” peanut butter. Stir in the honey and any additional salt, if you want.
        </li>
        <li>Store in the fridge or at room temperature if you think you’ll go through it fast enough.</li>
    </ol>
